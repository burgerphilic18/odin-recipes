    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Palak paneer is a popular North Indian vegetarian dish made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and spinach. The dish features paneer cubes simmered in a smooth, creamy spinach sauce flavored with garlic, ginger, and a blend of spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric. The spinach is typically pureed to create a vibrant green sauce, which is then cooked with the paneer until it absorbs the flavors. Palak paneer is often garnished with a drizzle of cream and served with rice or Indian bread like naan or roti. It's a nutritious and delicious dish that combines the goodness of spinach with the richness of paneer.</p>
