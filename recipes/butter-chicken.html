    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani, is a beloved Indian dish featuring succulent pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy, tomato-based sauce. The dish is typically made with marinated chicken that is grilled or pan-fried before being simmered in a rich, buttery sauce made from tomatoes, cream, butter, and a blend of aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, and fenugreek. The result is a velvety, mildly spiced curry that pairs wonderfully with naan or rice. Butter chicken is known for its luxurious texture and indulgent flavor, making it a favorite in Indian cuisine.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.</li>
        <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.</li>
        <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
